If C is chosen as a starting point, the sequence is: C, G, D, A, E, B (=C\u266d), F\u266f (=G\u266d), C\u266f (=D\u266d), A\u266d, E\u266d, B\u266d, F.

{"instruction": "why do human beings have a tendency to think they are always right?", "response": "As a first attempt to answer the question of why human beings\u00a0have a tendency to think they are always\u00a0right, we could point to cognitive biases, and in particular to one called \"confirmation bias\". This bias conditions human beings to use any new evidence to confirm their pre-existing beliefs,\u00a0and to reject any new\u00a0evidence that contradicts these beliefs. People may also experience the so-called illusory superiority, another bias that conditions them to overestimate their skills and make them believe they are superior to the rest. However these biases, as concrete as well-proven as they are, are only part of the explanation. The book\u00a0\"Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error\" by\u00a0Kathryn Schulz is an exploration on why humans have the tendency to disregard errors and think they are always right. Shulz describes how people start with the assumption that they are right in everything they believe, and when they realise they have made a mistake, instead of challenging this assumption, they actually feel relief\u00a0and think: \"I was right except for this particular error I was making, but now that I have realised it I can certainly say that I am 100% right in everything\"."}

{"instruction": "What are the merits of skipping breakfast? Can you target your answer to a typical American and describe in layman's terms rather than detailed scientific jargon?", "response": "A truism instilled in youths is \"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day\". A well-rounded breakfast may indeed lead to a productive and energetic day. However, advertisements often position breakfast as a dessert rather than a well-rounded meal. For example, many eat sugary cereal with large servings of milk to kickstart their day. This is ill-advised. One should consider a glass of water or cup of coffee in place of breakfast. Skipping breakfast creates a \"fast\" in the body, which allows restoration of vital biological functions without spending cycles digesting new nutrients. In short, if one skips breakfast, additional time and focused energy may be awarded, especially if the breakfast has a poor nutrient profile."}

But it wasn\u2019t until I went to high school and joined the swim team that Coach's role in my life grew and she became more than a parent or even a coach, but an advocate and role model.\n\nCoach left a lasting, positive impact on so many of us. Pushing us not only to be better swimmers, but to be humble leaders and stronger, more confident adults. \n\nEven though I would never be a star swimmer or D1 athlete, I never felt discouraged by Coach or anyone on her coaching staff. Quite the opposite: I threw myself into swimming. We all pushed ourselves to be the best we could be, we cheered as loud as we could on the sidelines, and no one passed up an opportunity to support the team or attend a team outing. Because Coach didn\u2019t just build teams of champion swimmers, she built a community. I\u2019m still close to many of my teammates \u2014 some remain my closest friends. That\u2019s because swimming is more than a sport at our school, it\u2019s a family. And Coach is and (in my mind) always will be the matriarch."}

Zafon is extremely talented, his words are elegant and poetic, and he paints Barcelona in a myriad of different ways: dark and gothic at night, or blissfully cheerful, or dreary gloom, all depending on the characters.\n\nI loved the cast of Shadow of the Wind. Each character was well developed and given an appropriate backstory. They bumped into each other in mysterious turns, and their interactions, like Daniel and Clara, or Daniel and Nuria, were heart wrenching.\n\nBut most of all, Zafon tells a wonderful story. I loved the parallels between Julian Carax and Daniel, and how Daniel's life becomes entangled with Julian's. It makes it feel much more like magical realism, and makes for an entertaining read."}

Some common recreational drugs include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs like ecstasy. While many countries consider recreational drug use legal, there are still laws surrounding their consumption and distribution. The EU has implemented various policies aimed at reducing recreational drug use and addressing issues related to drug trafficking within its borders.\n\nPeople often take recreational drugs because they want to experience feelings of euphoria, increased energy levels, or enhanced sensory perception. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, including dependence, withdrawal symptoms, impaired judgment and motor skills, and even death. Additionally, recreational drug use can lead to legal consequences, financial problems, strained relationships, and health issues such as mental illness, organ damage, and overdose. Despite these risks, many individuals continue to engage in recreational drug use due to peer pressure, stress relief, or simply for the thrill of it. Overall, recreational drug use poses significant dangers to both individual users and society as a whole."}
{"instruction": "What is an Oxford comma and why do editors have such strong feelings about their use?", "response": "An Oxford comma is a comma before the last item in a series or list. For example take the following two statements:\n\nI was chased by the fox, the bear and the dog.\nI was chased by the fox, the bear, and the dog.\n\nThe meaning is the same but the second statement contains an Oxford comma.\n\nSome say the Oxford comma adds clarity to some statements. This is apparent when there can be ambiguity between a list and an appositive. Take the following two example statements:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris and Terry.\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.\n\nThe first statement can appear to imply that we went to dinner with two people whose names are Chris and Terry who are both our coaches. There is no such implication that can be extracted from the second statement. The second statement implies we went to dinner with at least 4 people: Chris, Terry, and at least two coaches. This type of ambiguity is what proponents of the Oxford comma latch onto in its defense.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of the Oxford comma claim it should be avoided in favor of rewording sentences when necessary. The sentence:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.\n\nCan easily be reworded as:\n\nWe went to dinner with Chris and Terry, as well as our coaches.\n\nThe \"as well as\" language is claimed to be more clear than the Oxford comma albeit less concise. Editors who oppose the Oxford comma typically privilege clarity over conciseness."}

By avoiding such circumstances/conditions, we can be content and maybe that's what need in life: not strive to be happy all the time but avoid what we truly don't like so that happiness takes care of its own.\n\nAnswer 2: Yes! Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.\n\nAnswer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions. Getting through these hard times is actually makes a person stronger and more prepared for other calamities in life. We should not strive to be happy \"all the time\" -  instead we should take things as they come. In life, there is a need for moments of discontent as well as a need for moments of joy."}

{"instruction": "How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?", "response": "This exact question puzzled theologians for many hundreds of years, and led to many differing points of view. The issue with the question is that there is no correct answer- firstly, are angels real? If they are, how big are they? are they even able to dance? if they could dance, how much space would they need? Secondly, how big is the pin? is the pin a normal sized Earthly pin? or something much larger, on a celestial scale?\n\nThe answer relates to faith- if you believe in angels, you believe in their ability to dance, and believe in their specific ability to dance upon a pin, and can have an argument in any direction based on your faith that they underlying premise of the question could be a likelihood. If you do not have that faith, then your outlook would likely view this question with a great degree of cynicism, and you would probably view it as a pointless question.\n\nBut with a degree of humour, and a tip of the hat to Douglas Adams, I'm happy to conclude that the answer is 42."}

{"instruction": "Does parallel universe really exist?", "response": "When we talk about the possibility of multiple universes, we are referring to the idea that there could be many separate and distinct \u201crealities\u201d or \u201cworlds\u201d coexisting alongside our own. These universes may have different physical laws, properties, and dimensions, and could exist in parallel to our own universe. So basically, there\u2019s this idea that there could be lots of different universes happening at the same time, and there are couple of evidences that make people think it might be true.\nThere are several evidences for parallel universe, such as Hawking radiation, which says that anything going into a black hole might end up in another universe. or the gravity waves act oddly and deviate objects from their orbits, possibly due to the influence of parallel universes.\nThis idea of multiple universes has been proposed in various fields of science, including physics, astronomy, and even psychology. For example, Stephen Hawking was the leading theoretical physicist who advocated multiverse theory. I believe it remains a highly theoretical concept till today, and it is an area of active research and exploration, as scientists continue to investigate the possibility of parallel universes and their potential implications for our understanding of the universe and our place in it."}

{"instruction": "Why are cats better than dogs?", "response": "First, let me say that the question represents my own, personal, subjective opinion.  I also adore dogs, just not as much as cats.  I am fully a cat person.\nThe cat, though.  I am humbled by the task of trying to accurately capture in words the mystery of these beautiful creatures who have chosen to enslave humans.  So instead, because I am also trying to train a model, I will just use a lot of unnecessary adjectives and that will have to do.\nCats have been around humans for a long long time.  I remember as a kid having a book that talked about how in Ancient Egypt cats were revered as holy creatures and kept in luxury in temples of Baast.  The first known evidence of cat domestication is the excavation of a Neolithic grave in Cyprus.  The thing I adore about cats is that they basically haven\u2019t bothered to change themselves since then.  They just carried on being slightly aloof and mysterious, but also affectionate and playful when they feel like it.  And imperious and demanding, of course.  \nCats are incredible communicators.  They have learned to meow at humans because they realised we respond to meows, even though you will very rarely hear a cat meow at another cat (the indignity!).  Meows and chirps are the special condescending language cats developed to communicate with an inferior species.  My own cat can make crystal clear what he wants with looks, body language and the odd meow when he can be bothered.  He is also a total drama queen and obviously manipulative.  If he wants food he will try the \u2018I\u2019m hungry\u2019 meow first and if that doesn\u2019t work we get the full on \u201cI\u2019m starving, this is a tragedy, I will die almost immediately if I don\u2019t get food right now\u201d.  I am full of respect for the cats\u2019 ability to manipulate humans and the shamelessness with which they do this.\nCats are also super independent compared to dogs.  No need for walks, no need for the dreaded poo bags, no need for expensive care every time you want to go away for a night.  They love their humans but 100% on their own terms.  \nCats are adorable and cute.  I can\u2019t stress this enough.  Ever seen a cat roll over so you can see its fluffy belly.  How can you not melt.  Ever had a cat make biscuits on your lap (or in the air).  Cuteness overload.  They are even cute when they are mad.  And most cats I\u2019ve met know how to gently tell you what affection is allowed and what isn\u2019t (illegal belly rubs).  They will bat you with a paw, but the claws will be in.  And a cat purring on your lap is the single most relaxing thing in the whole world.\nThe Swedish word for \u2018cat\u2019 is \u2018kattepus\u2019.  That in itself seems a really great reason why cats are better than dogs.\nThe last word goes to Terry Pratchett, author of the Discworld novels, who wrote \u2018In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this\u2019.  And neither should we."}

{"instruction": "What is WestWorld?", "response": "Westworld is an American dystopian science fiction western television series created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy that first aired on October 2, 2016, on HBO. It was based upon the 1973 film of the same name written and directed by Michael Crichton and loosely upon its 1976 sequel, Futureworld.\n\nThe story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced Wild-West-themed amusement park populated by android \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying guests who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' setting expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful artificial intelligence named Rehoboam.\n\nNolan and Joy served as showrunners. The second, third and fourth season followed in April 2018, March 2020, and June 2022, respectively. Nolan and Joy planned a fifth and final season, and were in negotiations with HBO to produce it. However, in November 2022, it was announced that HBO had canceled the series. The series was removed from HBO Max on December 18, 2022.\n\nWestworld's debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective, in 2014. Westworld's first season is the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. The first season also received critical acclaim and was highly praised for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes and soundtrack from Ramin Djawadi. Reception of the series declined from the second season onwards, with the scripts, characterization and narrative opacity being targeted for criticism; viewership ratings also diminished throughout its run. It has received numerous accolades, winning nine Primetime Emmy Awards out of 54 nominations. Thandiwe Newton won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2018."}

Danny's coach took him to the doctor and the doctor said he would need surgery to fix his foot and that he should try a different hobby than baseball, so his foot would have time to heal. Danny started thinking about how he could keep that feeling of hitting homers while he wasn't able to play baseball. He started thinking about those comets he was hitting into space, and he decided to start reading about astronomy. Astronomy, it turns out, is really interesting! Danny learned about planets and suns and moons. He loved that he could imagine the solar system as one big baseball game. His aunt bought him a telescope so he could see his homers in outer space.

{"instruction": "What are the most important tools to own when I am an apartment renter?", "response": "As a renter, you\u2019ll often find yourself hanging pictures, assembling furniture, installing floating shelves, opening and cutting up boxes, storing things on high shelves, tightening screws or bolts that come loose over time, cleaning cobwebs, measuring furniture or a room where you\u2019d like to put furniture, unclogging a toilet, or any number of other activities centered around daily apartment life. \n\nTo do these things, you\u2019ll need a small number of tools, including:\n- A standard toilet plunger, because toilets get clogged. Get this most important tool first.\n- A 1\u201d wide tape measure. Get one that\u2019s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.\n- A small level to evenly hang pictures and anything else you can think of. It should be about 10\u201d to 12\u201d long.\n- A pair of #2 Phillips head and #2 flat tip screwdrivers. Or, a ratcheting screwdriver with a set of replaceable screwdriver tips. To tighten loose screws or assemble furniture.\n- A folding step-stool that has two or three steps, and can support two to three hundred pounds. To quickly and safely reach those high shelves, hang pictures, and get close to things that are too high off the ground for you to reach standing in your flat shoes.\n- A comfortable-in-hand hammer, to drive nails for hanging pictures, gently tap things together, or break things apart. A wooden handled, curved-claw hammer that weighs between 12oz-16oz will serve most users well. When pulling nails, place a thin piece of wood between the hammerhead and delicate surfaces such as sheetrock to avoid damaged. Good hardware stores carry both.\n- A pair of adjustable wrenches for tightening just about anything. You\u2019ll often need a pair of\nwrenches to both hold and tighten the same fastener. A smaller 8\u201d and larger 10\u201d adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood\u2026etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand\u2026you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called Allen keys. You\u2019ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes. Both are useful to have, but if you only buy one set, make it metric, as it\u2019s the most common type of fastener used to assemble furniture.\n- A stud finder. Stud finders help you locate the wall studs hidden behind the sheetrock. You\u2019ll need to know where the wall studs are in order to know which fasteners you can use.\n- A tool box or bag. The only rule here is that the bag needs to hold all of your tools. So, you should probably buy this after you\u2019ve owned and used a few of the tools listed previously, and have a better idea how you\u2019d like to store them, carry them and access them.\n- A cordless drill and impact driver set, if you can afford it. All the other tools are more important, but these two tools are incredibly useful and make many jobs go faster and more pleasantly. The drill is for drilling. The impact driver is for driving or removing screws and other common fasteners. They look similar, but they are 2 different tools, each giving the user the right kinds of power and feedback required for the job each is designed for. It pays to buy quality here, so buy the best you can afford."}

The Suns are one of four major league sports teams based in the Phoenix area, but are the only one to bill themselves as representing the city (the other teams - the Cardinals, Coyotes, and Diamondbacks - all bill themselves as representing the state of Arizona).\n\nThe franchise began play in 1968 as an expansion team, and their early years were mired in mediocrity, but their fortunes changed in the 1970s after partnering Dick Van Arsdale and Alvan Adams with Paul Westphal; the team reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture a championship, the Suns would rebuild around Walter Davis for a majority of the 1980s, until the acquisition of Kevin Johnson in 1988.\n\nUnder Johnson, and after trading for perennial NBA All-Star Charles Barkley, and combined with the output of Tom Chambers and Dan Majerle, the Suns reached the playoffs for a franchise-record thirteen consecutive appearances and remained a regular title contender throughout the 1990s, and reached the 1993 NBA Finals. However, the team would again fail to win a championship, and entered into another period of mediocrity until the early part of the 2000s.\n\nIn 2004, the Suns signed free agent Steve Nash (who had blossomed for the Dallas Mavericks after being traded from Phoenix six years earlier), and returned into playoff contention. With Nash, Shawn Marion, and Amar'e Stoudemire, and under head coach Mike D'Antoni, the Suns became renowned worldwide for their quick, dynamic offense, which led them to tie a franchise record in wins in the 2004\u201305 season. Two more top two Conference placements followed, but the Suns again failed to attain an NBA championship, and were forced into another rebuild. After ten consecutive seasons without a playoff berth, the Suns reached the 2021 NBA Finals after acquiring Chris Paul, forming a quartet with their young core of Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges. Following a disappointing playoff exit in 2022, the Suns acquired 13-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant.\n\nThe Suns own the NBA's fifth-best all-time winning percentage, and have the second highest winning percentage of any team to have never won an NBA championship. 11 Hall of Famers have played for Phoenix, while two \u2014 Barkley and Nash \u2014 won NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) while playing for the team. Additionally, their Hall of Fame radio announcer Al McCoy is the longest-tenured broadcaster in NBA history."}
{"instruction": "For what is known as Transphonologization?", "response": "In historical linguistics, transphonologization (also known as rephonologization or cheshirization, see below) is a type of sound change whereby a phonemic contrast that used to involve a certain feature X evolves in such a way that the contrast is preserved, yet becomes associated with a different feature Y.\n\nFor example, a language contrasting two words */sat/ vs. */san/ may evolve historically so that final consonants are dropped, yet the modern language preserves the contrast through the nature of the vowel, as in a pair /sa/ vs. /s\u00e3/. Such a situation would be described by saying that a former contrast between oral and nasal consonants has been transphonologized into a contrast between oral and nasal vowels.\n\nThe term transphonologization was coined by Andr\u00e9-Georges Haudricourt. The concept was defined and amply illustrated by Hag\u00e8ge & Haudricourt; it has been mentioned by several followers of panchronic phonology, and beyond."}

We will be harnessing power easily from abundant natural resources inside and outside of the solar system. All work will be automated and done by machines. Human labor will not be required anymore, be it in the factories or service industry or even in the medical fields. The elite class or the top 1% rich in the world will own all of the corporations and run it. They will not need the rest of the 99% of people in the world as they do will not require their services to run factories and corporations and make them profitable. The elite will see them including any existing forms of their government as a liability. There would be absolutely no functioning government in any part of the world and access to the elite cities or areas will be cut off from the rest of the population. The only people saved would be famous artists or athletes or anyone with creative skills. Rest of the people will be left to fend for themselves and all the progress made as a civilized society will be lost. Whomever is able to survive will set up small communities and continue life. But life will be hard for lack of food and medical care. Some communities may attempt to take out the elite cities but will fail. Eventually the 99% would perish after a few hundred years. The elites will have problems of their own like fights between corporations. But almost all of them will survive for generations and several thousands of years until some catastrophic event wipes them all out be it an alien invasion or something from natural causes."}

{"instruction": "What is nihilism and why do some people believe it? List some ways that philosophers have proposed to fight against nihilism. Explain to me in a casual tone", "response": "Nihilism is a belief that life is ultimately meaningless. Sounds pretty depressing right? Well, there are a number of reasons why one might feel this way. Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window \u2014 who is to say one\u2019s value is wrong?\n\nEnter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus \u2014 rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top \u2014 an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because \u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it. Note that this is a very extensive topic and what I covered here is only the tip of the iceberg, I\u2019d suggest reading up more if you're interested. Hope it helped!"}

First, it's important to remain patient and diligent around maintaining a strict schedule for feeding, rest, play and potty times.  This should start the  moment your puppy arrives as this is going to set them and you up for success.  Second, when accidents happen, which will occur for the first few weeks, remember to be patient and kind to your puppy.  This will develop a deep sense of trust in you as the authority figure in the home.  \n\nGenerally, puppies need to be let outside to go potty outside within a secure area after waking, playtime and after every meal.  It's important not to confuse potty time with playtime and that your puppy is placed safely in a crate or gated area if they aren't being watched closely.   \n\nHow do you know when your puppy needs to go potty?  \n\nMost puppies will begin sniffing the ground when they need to go potty so if you witness this happening indoors, quickly usher your puppy outside or to a training pad.  It's important to provide your puppy a lot of praise for a job well done.  For some puppies, verbal praise from their family member while providing them with a small treat will help your puppy make the connection that going potty in the appropriate area is a very good thing for them and for you."}

{"instruction": "What are the benefits of ranked voting?", "response": "In elections for political office, ranked voting allows second, third and lower preference choices to be given weight in the event a voter's higher ranked choices do not show the electoral strength necessary to win a given election. In this way, overall social utility is maximized in the sense that the optimal level of voter happiness will be achieved. Ranked voting will give centrist and more moderate candidates and parties a greater chance to succeed in elections, reducing the power of the extreme elements on both sides of the political spectrum. It will encourage more moderate candidates to step forward and more moderate third parties to form. The extreme partisanship currently existing in politics will be mitigated. Donald Trump would likely not have won the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 because, although he had a very committed backing of a large minority of Republican voters, he faced a divided field of more moderate and traditional candidates who split the more rational majority of the party. Trump would likely not have been the second choice for many of the backers of other candidates. A more moderate candidate would likely have emerged as the eventual nominee. Opponents of ranked voting cite possible complexity and greater threat of computerized hacking or errors impacting election results. Entrenched politicians of both major parties oppose ranked voting because they do not want to encourage the formation of centrist third parties that could jeopardize the standing of their parties and their own political careers."}

{"instruction": "Why do Americans feel so strongly about gun control?", "response": "The reason Americans feel so strongly about gun control is partly rooted in the history of the United States. Originally, colonial Americans mostly lived outside of towns, farming and hunting in the countryside. This meant that guns were not just for protection, they were for obtaining crucial food resources. The British threat to take away guns was more than a political imposition limiting resistance to British rule, it was potentially a life-threatening policy to families who depended on obtaining food via hunting. This background is in part why Americans originally had such a strong reaction to normalizing gun controls and access, which was codified as a right to bear arms in our Constitution. However, by contrast this aspect of the rationale against gun control largely does not exist today. Gun usage is for sport, and for protection, and only minimally to provide food on the table. However, because of this history, and constitutional codification, Americans feel justified in maintaining one of the world's most vigorous objections to any regulation or controls."}

{"instruction": "What are some disadvantages of the way the tax code treats incentive stock options?", "response": "There are three primary problems with the way the tax code treats incentive stock options. First, the tax code gives an employee a strong incentive to exercise the options early on, to achieve the tax benefit relating to the special option treatment. This means the tax code encourages young employees to write a check to their employer at a time when their entire financial life is likely to be dependent on that employer. This is the exact opposite of diversification, a key goal of personal financial management. The second issue is that the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is imposed at the time of exercise. This requires a potentially large cash outlay, at a time when the employee is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to meet the burden. So not only does the employee have to pay his or her employer to cover the exercise premium, he or she has to send funds to the Internal Revenue Service as well. Finally, the requirement that an employee terminating employment must exercise within three months of termination date to preserve the tax advantage of the options encourages exercise at a time when the employee may not have sufficient funds, and may be looking at financial uncertainty if he or she does not yet have a new job lined up. The advantages of incentive stock options are significant, but they encourage the wrong behavior."}

{"instruction": "What are books are available to get an understanding of California prior to the gold-rush of 1849?", "response": "A great resource for pre-Gold Rush California is the book \"Two Years Before the Mast\" by Richard Henry Dana who stepped away from Harvard Law School and signed up for a tour on the merchant vessel out of Boston in 1834. The book describes the voyage around the treacherous Cape Horn under the leadership of a hard and driving captain who shows little remorse or regard for his crew as the ship is battered below the cape by the confluence of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Awareness of Ahab of Melville's Moby Dick cannot help but inform your mental picture of this captain. \n\nThe ship makes its way up the coast, passing the newly independent countries of South and central America, to the northern part of Mexico, an area called Alta California. Traveling along the coast, the ship trades with the Spanish and indigenous peoples in tiny settlements and missions named San Diego, San Pedro, San Juan, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora La Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncula, Santa Barbara, Monterey and north to San Francisco Bay. \n\nDana's detailed descriptions of the natural harborages and the tiny settlements and missions are richly described and contrast sharply with the California we see today. One is left with the singular impression of the remoteness of California to those traveling from east cost of North America or Europe.  \n\nThe crew was trading in hides and tallow, incredible to those reading from contemporary times, who consider the distance of the journey and the archaicness of the cargo. The trading goods seem altogether more ancient when considering the change the entire area would undergo in 1848 at Sutter's Mill."}

{"instruction": "Create a workout to strengthen my upper body", "response": "If you have access to weights, a workout might start with four sets of bench press and four sets of upright row at 6 to 10 reps each to strengthen your chest and back. If you don\u2019t have access to weights you could replace those exercises with some combination of push ups, pull ups, and chin ups. Next move into three sets of shoulder press and rear delt raises for ten reps each. Finally, do three sets of bicep curls and three sets of tricep dips for ten and thirty reps respectively. The weights and repetitions for each exercise should scale with your comfort and ability doing that exercise. \n\nWhen working out, it\u2019s very important to use good form and not overextend yourself. When lifting heavy weights it\u2019s a good idea to get help from a spotter, and in particular you should never do bench press alone.

{"instruction": "Explain gravity", "response": "Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. \nGravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.\nHowever, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."}

Ten plus years later, he ended as the club's all-time leading goal scorer and holds the record for number of Premier League Hat-tricks. \n\nIn 2012, Manchester City and local rivals, Manchester United were leading a two horse race to win the Premier League. Manchester United had previously won the league title 19 times where as this would be Manchester City's first title in over 40 years. \n\nIt was Manchester City's to lose as they hosted relegation-bounded QPR at the Etihad Stadium and all was going to plan going into the first half following Zabaleta's goal to make it 1-0 (an unlikely goal scorer to say the least). \n\nHowever, following a mistake from centre back, Joleon Lescott, a dramatic red card for former Manchester City player, Joey Barton and a surprise second goal from QPR to make it 2-1, Manchester City looked as though they'd let the title slip through their hands. \n\nManchester United had won their away game at Sunderland 1-0 so it was all down the blue half of Manchester's result. \n\nJust after the 90th minute, they were in stoppage time which was extended due to the commotions with Joey Barton lashing out at Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero. \n\nStriker, Edin Dzeko, scored a header from a David Silva cross to make it 2-2, but to many, this felt as too little, too late. \n\nLate drama unfolded as Mario Balotelli registered his one and only assist in almost 4 years at the club as he laid it off to Aguero who scored the winning goal with the last kick of the game to make it 3-2. \n\nManchester City went on to win the league and QPR avoided relegation despite the loss due to results elsewhere."}

{"instruction": "Should I buy a gravel bike or a down country mountain bike?", "response": "Although there is reasonable overlap in what you can use gravel and downcountry bikes for, the answer her largely depends on what you plan to do the most of and if trail riding will be important for you. Gravel bikes are great for covering offroad miles more efficiently and long days in the saddle both on road or offroad. However, the lack of any meaningful suspension means that or but a small amount of time off paths and more established trails will be hard work. Downcountry bikes will enable you to go on a wider range of terrain, inlcuding the ability to do trail riding (be very careful before trying to navigate downhill trails on a gravel bike!). However, downcountry bikes are usually heavier but the full suspension and geometry makes them less efficient compared to a gravel bike."}

{"instruction": "what is Modern Talking?", "response": "First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks, the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide. The track was then followed by another number-one hit, \"You Can Win If You Want\", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.\n\nSoon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000. The success continued with another two number one singles, \"Brother Louie\" and \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and \"Jet Airliner\" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.\n\nDue to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.\n\nDuring this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song \"Brother Louie\". In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts. They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.\n\nNotably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1997\nImmediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like \"Sorry Little Sarah\", \"My Bed Is Too Big\", \"Under My Skin\", \"Love Suite\", \"Laila\" and \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country. Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal. He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.\n\n1998\u20132003: Reunion\nIn the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries, eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.\n\nBohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation. The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003. In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS."}

{"instruction": "What is the Tau Circle Constant?", "response": "Tau is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius.  Some 21st century mathematicians and physicists believe Tau is a better choice than Pi for use in science and mathematics.\n\nLike Pi, Tau is an irrational and transcendental number.  In decimal form, the value of Tau is 6.283185\u2026\n\nPart of the motivation for Tau is the observation that the number 2*Pi or 2\u03c0 occurs with surprising frequency throughout science and mathematics.  This raises the question of whether Pi is really an important number or something equal to two times Pi is actually more important.  Perhaps the implication is that Pi is exactly one half of some very important number!\n\nFurther consideration of the question leads to several compelling observations:\n\n\t- Using C/r as the key circle constant is better aligned with the way we define a circle: the set of all points a fixed distance (r) form a give point.\n\t- Radian angle measurements of fraction of a circle make much more sense when Tau is used as the base constant.  Using Pi, on quarter of a circle is Pi is Pi/2, one half is Pi, and the angle of a a full circle is 2*Pi.  With Tau, the angle measures are intuitively aligned to the fraction of a circle: a quarter circle is Tau/4, a half circle is Tau/2 and the angle of a full circle is Tau.  \n\t- Similarly, the radian zeroes, max, and min of the sin and cosine functions align to fractions of Tau in an intuitive fashion that aids, rather than confuses, understanding.\n\t- Key formulas that traditionally use Pi actually show more clear mathematical meaning when expressed using Tau.  For example, the area of a circle itself, when expressed with Tau, shows the same pattern of quadratic forms in distance fallen, spring energy, and kinetic energy.\n\t- Similarly, the tau-based formula for circular area actually confirms to the original proof by Archimedes showing that area of a circle equals the area of a triangle with base C (circumference) and height r (radius):  A = 1/2 b*h = 1/2 C*r = 1/2 (Tau*r)*r = 1/2 Tau*r^2.\n\n\nTau has seen significant adoption since it was originally proposed.  \n\nThe relationship between Tau and Pi is very simple.  Tau = 2*Pi.  Perhaps just as informative is the fact that Tau > Pi."}

{"instruction": "What is a metaverse?", "response": "In science fiction, the \"metaverse\" is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal, and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets. In colloquial usage, a \"metaverse\" is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social and economic connection.\n\nThe term \"metaverse\" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of \"meta\" and \"universe\". Metaverse development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology due to the increasing demands for immersion. Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3, a concept for a decentralized iteration of the internet. Web3 and metaverse have been used as buzzwords to exaggerate the development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes. Information privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole."}

Hawaii passed state laws in 2019 and 2021 to ban using plastics in food service, beverage bottles, utensils, stirring sticks, polystyrene foam containers, and straws. These are the first state-wide bans on food service plastics in America. \n- On social effect perspective, there are tensions between Native Hawaiians and residents who hold negative views towards tourism and visitors and the increasingly booming tourism industry."}
{"instruction": "How can I tell my sourdough starter is ready to use?", "response": "You can look for a few signs to see if your sourdough starter is ready to use. One common sign to look for is whether the starter has at least doubled in volume. Time can be a difficult indicator as how long it takes for a starter to double volume can vary based on temperature, hydration, and other factors. Another sign to look for is a lot of bubbles throughout the starter - this can be seen if your starter is in a glass container. Lastly, get to know your starter as you bake with it because each starter has its own unique characteristics. Learn what it will smell like when it matures - this can help you establish a baseline and identify when something is wrong with the starter as it smells \"funky\"."}

{"instruction": "What is structural genomics?", "response": "Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.\n\nBecause protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.\n\nAs opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.\n\nStructural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.\n\nWhile most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A Science article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.\n\nOne advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely Open protein structure annotation network (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers."}

{"instruction": "Can 4 working days a week achieve same result as 5 working days a week?", "response": "Firstly 4 day work week is not working overtime for the same hours over 4 days. Rather it is generally defined as reduced working hours. It has tried in different parts of the world on an experimental basis and a few of the organisations have adopted it permanently. Reducing working hours is not a completely a new idea. Over the last century, the working hours have been reduced and it has benefited employees as well as employers. A few key benefits include reduced burnout of employees, higher productivity, reduced carbon footprint and less number of absences. It can also help attract talent in the job market. However it can increase cost of the employer. In addition, it may not be suitable for all industries or employees. in summary, it is one of the viable option and based on the industry, it might be adopted further in the near future."}

It also acts on (Gram-positive) staphylococci bacteria which cause skin and soft tissue infections such as boils.  Penicillin was also found to have an anti-bacterial action on the Gram-negative bacteria which causes gonorrhoea.  There were a series of fortuitous circumstances which combined to allow the discovery of penicillin, one of which was Sir Alexander's choice to take a holiday with his family after leaving staphylococci bacteria in a culture in his lab before departure.  Anecdotally Sir Alexander was a little sloppy with lab hygiene which contributed to his previous discovery of lysozyme and it seems the same lack of care was partly responsible for the discovery of penicillin.  Lastly the specific location of his lab and cultures played a role - the fungal contaminant that had an anti-bacterial effect on the staphylococci culture came from Sir Alexander's colleagues lab one floor below"}
